# uscore-data-sets


Inferno supplies multiple synthetic data sets suitable for testing. These data sets are ideal for testing
because they provide coverage of all US Core profiles and support for all MUST SUPPORT data elements without
requiring a large set of patients or sacrificing realism.


Use of these data sets is optional.


The synthetic data sets are available for download in compressed archives:

 - **Single patient** with all US Core profiled resources and USCDI elements
 - **Small population**, handful of patients covering all US Core profiles and USCDI elements
 - **Large population**, hundreds of patients covering all US Core profiles and USCDI elements


Each data set is available as FHIR JSON Transaction Bundles and FHIR Bulk Data format.


Additional data sets can be generated using the open-source [Synthea<sup>TM</sup>](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea) tool and the [Inferno US Core Data Script](https://github.com/inferno-community/uscore-data-script).
